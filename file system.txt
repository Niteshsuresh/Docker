File System

	File system controls the way data is stored and retrieved. Without file system the information stored in a medium
	would be one large body of data with no way to tell where data starts and ends.
	
	By separating the data into pieces where each piece is an isolated information and called as "file". The structure and logic
	used to manage such system is known as a file system
	
	A file system consists of two or three layers. 
	
	Logical, virtual and physical file system.
	> Physical file system is concerned with the physical operation of the storage devices. It processes physical blocks being read or
	  written. 
	  Handles buffering and memory management and is responsible for the physical placement of the blocks in specific locations on the
	  storage medium. They interact with device drivers to operate on storage devices.	  
	
	> Virtual file system
	  This interface allows multiple concurrent physical file systems, each of which is a physical file system		
	
	> Logical file system is responsible for interaction with user application. It provides application program interface (API) for 
	  file operations - OPEN, CLOSE, READ etc. Providers "file access, directory operations, security and protection"
