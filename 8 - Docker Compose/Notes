Docker Compose
 - Was build by the docker community to address the problem orchestrating multiple
   Containers into one app solution
 - Initally it was called Fig and later it was re-branded as "Docker compose"
 - A tool used to defining and running multi-container application in an easy way.

At first, we need to create a file called docker-compose.yml
