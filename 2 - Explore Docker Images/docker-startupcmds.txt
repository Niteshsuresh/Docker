Proper way to run docker images

1. We need spin up the image by docker run cmd
	docker run <imagename>
	Use 
	--it to run in interactive mode
	--d to run in detached mode [useful when we want to host software/services)

2. If the container was running detach mode and if we need to start the shell
	docker exec -it CONTAINER_NAME/id bash

3. If the container is stopped or exited, to start it again
	docker start CONTAINER_NAME/id
