Building docker containers using Apache web server on ubuntu.

1. Let's build docker image for web server.
		FROM ubuntu 
		RUN apt-get update 
		RUN apt-get install –y apache2 
		RUN apt-get install –y apache2-utils 
		RUN apt-get clean 
		EXPOSE 80
		CMD [“apache2ctl”, “-D”, “FOREGROUND”]
	
	We are first creating our image from the base ubuntu image
	We are running update all the packages cmd
	We are running apache2 cmd to install apache2 server
	We are running apache2-utils cmd to install necessary apache2 utilities
	We are running clean cmd to remove all unnecessary files
	The EXPOSE cmd is used to expose port 80 of apache container to Docker host
	Finally, the CMD command is used to run apache2 in the background
	
2. Create container from the image
	sudo docker run -d -p 80:80 mywebserver
	
	The port no exposed by container is 80
	using -p option, we are mapping the same port number to the 80 port of localhost
	using -d option, we are running the container in detached mode. So that the container runs in the background.
