Docker frequently used commands
 docker ps -- list all available containers
 docker search -- search the docker hub for images. sudo docker search ubuntu
 docker pull <image> -- docker image will be downloaded from docker repository
 docker images -- used to see all the downloaded images
 docker rmi <<imageID>> -f -- To remove the image from local docker repository
 docker logs <<containerID>> -- to get log writes in detached docker mode
 docker run image -- creates an instance of an image, which is then called container. 
	eg:- sudo docker -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 jenkins
		 sudo docker run -it centos /bin/bash 	
 docker stop <<containerID>> -- [stop the running instance of given image. preserves the state of container in docker ps -a. 
 Sends SIGTERM first then SIGKILL after a grace period.]
 docker inspect <<imagename>> -- show the detailed information of image eg: sudo docker inspect jenkins 
 docker top <<containerID>> -- show the top-level processes within a container
 docker rm <<containerID>> -- 
 [will remove the container from docker ps -a list, which looses its state of layered file systems written on top of image file system.
 Sends SIGKILL]
 docker stats <<containerID>> -- provides the statistics of running container. Which including CPU and Memory utilization of the container.
 docker attach <<containerID>> -- we can get connected or attached to the running docker container.
 docker pause <<containerID>> -- will pause the running processes in the docker container
 docker unpause <<containerID>> -- will unpause the running processes in the docker container
 sudo service docker start -- command used to start the docker daemon process
 sudo service docker stop -- command used to stop the docker daemon process
 Cntrl + P + Q -- To exit the program and or type exit
 
 nsenter command to help in exiting container without destroying it
 1. docker run --rm -v /usr/local/bin:/target jpetazzo/nsenter
 2. Find Pid using docker inspect. sudo docker inspect <<containerId>> | grep Pid
 
 nsenter -m -u -n -p -i -t <<PID>> /bin/bash
 
 -u is used to mention the Uts namespace
 -m is used to mention the mount namespace
 -n is used to mention the network namespace
 -p is used to mention the process namespace
 -i is used to make the container run in interactive mode
 -t is used to connect I/O stream of the process to the host OS
 
 sudo docker kill <<containerID>>
