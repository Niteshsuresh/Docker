1. Instead of using DockerHub public repository, we can manage containers in our own
private repository.
	For this, we need to download repository container from docker. 
	a. To setup, we need to download private registry.
		sudo docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name registry registry:2
		registry -> container managed by Docker to host private repositories
		port -> 5000 is port no exposed by container. Using -p we mapping 5000 with local port 5000
		-d is used to run container in detached mode. so that, its goes into the background process.
